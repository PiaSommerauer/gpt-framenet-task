      "A Michigan teenager says she feels like a \"warrior princess\" after surviving a mass shooting that left her critically injured.\n",
      "Abigail Kopf, 14, is finally home two months after being shot and nearly killed in the February shooting. She was one of two people injured during multiple shootings in the Kalamazoo area that left six dead.\n",
      "The accused shooter, then-Uber driver Jason Dalton, has been arrested and charged with murder.\n",
      "Abigail's injuries, which included being shot in the head, were so severe that her heart stopped and her medical team was concerned she might become brain dead, according to Bronson Children's Hospital, where she was treated. The teen is now able to walk and talk, telling ABC News she hopes she can do \"cartwheels again\" after she recovers.\n",

      "\"She can walk, she can do stairs, she can pretty much move very well on her own,\" mom Vicki Kopf said.\n",
      "Kopf said her daughter has shown great strength as she continues to recover, spending six weeks in a rehabilitation center after the shooting.\n",

      "Dalton, a Kalamazoo resident, was arrested on Feb. 21 after allegedly going on the shooting rampage in three separate incidents the day before. He was charged with six counts of murder, two counts of assault with intent to commit murder and eight charges of using a firearm during the commission of a felony. A \"not guilty\" plea was entered on Dalton's behalf by the judge at his arraignment, according the prosecutor assigned to the case.\n",

      "KALAMAZOO, MI -- A Mattawan High School senior is among six victims who were killed in a shooting rampage in Kalamazoo Saturday night, the schools superintendent said.\n",
      "Tyler Smith, 17, was killed in the parking lot of Seelye Kia, 4102 Stadium Drive, along with his father, Richard, said Robin Buchler, Mattawan school district superintendent. The father, 53, and son were looking at cars shortly before 10:30 p.m. when police say Jason Brian Dalton shot and killed them in a parking lot.\n",
      "It was the second of three shooting scenes in Kalamazoo County where, police say, Dalton shot eight people, killing six and injuring two.\n",
      "Buchler said social media is \"exploding\" with Mattawan students expressing disbelief about Smith's death.\n",
      "\"We have a lot of kids that are just really panicking a bit,\" Buchler said.\n",
      "\"It just doesn't make sense to them. There's just a feeling of fear and not wanting to really venture out right now. I think it's just because there's just no logic that it would happen.\"\n",
      "Smith has been a student at Mattawan schools since eighth grade. Buchler said he's enrolled in the marketing entrepreneurship program at the tech center and also at the high school\n",
      "Buchler said her son, also a senior, had a senior seminar class with Smith.\n",
      "\"He was really a great kid and really well liked,\" Buchler said. \"It's just so traumatic, just heartbreaking.\"\n",
      "Buchler said she will meet with her crisis team from the school district this afternoon. She said counselors will be available for students and staff to talk to at school Monday.\n",
      "\"We will take care of our students and staff,\" Buchler said.\n",
