    "# Event co-reference task\n",
    "\n",
    "News articles often report on incidents (e.g. a terrorist attack or a natural disaster). Different articles may report on the same incident, but approach it from different perspectives. For instance, an article may have been written right after the event occured, several weeks after the event occured (when new information is uncovered or follow-up events occur) or even years after the event (reflecting on its implications). There is a high degree of linguistic variation in how such events are expressed in text. It is very difficult for automatic systems to recognize if two texts are about the same indicident or not (i.e. perform event coreference).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of the Dutch FrameNet project, we have collected texts about real-world incidents using information about indicdents from Wikidata and Wikipedia. Through these resources, we were able to compile corpora of news articles that all report on the same indicent. The indicents can further be categorized in event types (e.g. mass shooting, royal wedding, etc.). This approach provides us with a challenging event-coreference dataset; we have texts reporting on the same incident written at different times after the event (and potentially containing a high degree of variation in referring to the same indicent) and texts about different incidents of the same type, thus potentially containing a high degree of similar expressions and even ambiguity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of our texts have manually been annotated in terms of semantic roles (as represented in FrameNet). In contrast to traditional SRL, we annotate frames on the level of the entire document instead of on the level of sentences. In addition, we capture information about whether a frame expresses information about target incident we are focusing on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this hackathon, we propose a binary event-coreference task containing three subtasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Subtask 1: Are the two texts about the same incident? (gold: structured data information - target incidents)\n",
    "* Subtask 2: Provide an explanation of your answer giving evidence from the text (gold: frame annotations)\n",
    "* Subtask 3: Perform event linking: Name the incident or incidents the texts are about (gold: structured data information - target incidents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Subtask 3 may seem particularly uncrealistic for \"a humble language model\". However, given that models are being trained on virtually all data on the internet, it could be interesting to explore how much of this information the model captures and how reliably it can produce it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data: to be made available soon. \n"

      "“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.\n",
      "“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”\n",
      "Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:\n",
      "▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.\n",

      "▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.\n",
      "“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.\n",
      "At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.\n",
      "Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.\n",
      "Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.\n",
      "Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.\n",
      "Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.\n",
      "“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.\n",
      "The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.\n",
      "“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.\n",
      "“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”\n",

      "Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.\n",
      "Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”\n",
      "He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.\n",
      "He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.\n",
      "Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.\n",
      "Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”\n",
      "He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.\n",
      "They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.\n",

      "He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.\n",
      "Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.\n",
      "“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”\n",

      "A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.\n",
      "He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.\n",
      "His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.\n",
      "It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.\n",
      "In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.\n",
      "The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”\n",
      "“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.\n",
      "A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”\n",
      "Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.\n",
      "In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.\n",
      "“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”\n",
      "Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”\n",
      "The wounded\n",
      "Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.\n",
      "Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.\n",
      "Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.\n",
      "Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.\n",
      "Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.\n",
      "Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.\n",
      "Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.\n",

      "Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.\n",
      "U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.\n",
      "And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.\n",
      "Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.\n",
      "Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\n",
      "The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.\n",
      "He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.\n",
      "Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.\n",
      "There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.\n",
      "According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.\n",
      "Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.\n",
      "“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.\n",
      "Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n",
      "Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.\n",
      "However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.\n",
      "A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.\n",
      "The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.\n",
      "According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.\n",
      "Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.\n",
      "“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”\n",
      "Ford had a tumultuous past.\n",
      "In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.\n",
      "In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”\n",
      "That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.\n",
      "“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”\n",
      "According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.\n",
      "Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.\n",
      "“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.\n",
      "According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.\n",
      "Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.\n",
      "“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”\n",
      "The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.\n",
      "“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.\n",
      "Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.\n",
      "“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”\n",
      "Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.\n",
      "“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”\n",

       "'Four dead, including gunman, in Kansas workplace shooting | The Wichita Eagle.\\n\\nAn employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.\\nTwo other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.\\nThe suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.\\n“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”\\nWalton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.\\nNews alerts in your inbox Sign up for email alerts and be the first to know when news breaks. Recaptcha SIGN UP This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\\nThe shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.\\n“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.\\n“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”\\nLaw enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:\\n▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.\\nLocal news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal\\n▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.\\nThe vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.\\n▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.\\n“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.\\nAt 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.\\nWalton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.\\nWalton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.\\nWalton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.\\nFifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.\\n“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.\\nThe shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.\\n“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.\\n“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”\\n‘Everybody was running’\\nGunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.\\nMarty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”\\nHe said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.\\nHe said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.\\nJacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.\\nThen he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”\\nHe said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.\\nThey loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.\\nA law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.\\nAn employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.\\n“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.\\nHe said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.\\n“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.\\nHe said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.\\nKasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.\\n“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”\\nSuspect’s background\\nA preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.\\nHe has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.\\nHis Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.\\nIt was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.\\nIn what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.\\nThe woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”\\n“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.\\nA Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”\\nPolice categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.\\nIn her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.\\n“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”\\nNext to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”\\nThe wounded\\nVia Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.\\nWichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.\\nNewton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.\\nNewton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.\\nWalton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.\\nLate Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.\\nInside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.\\nExcel Industries, 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston, touts itself on its website as a “leading manufacturer of turf care products,” including Hustler Turf Equipment and BigDog Mower Co. lines.\\nData curated by FindTheData\\n'"
