",Q23012840,"Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court","Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court.

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting. Excel Industries is at 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston.
Ford was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed Friday in Hopkins’ case. Authorities say Hopkins was aware of his criminal history.
She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.
I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor
“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case. She did ask, however, that as a condition of bond, Hopkins turn over any other guns she has in her possession to ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The judge noted that the request was unusual, saying he orders defendants to surrender firearms as a matter of course.
Asked whether he objected to Furst’s request, Hopkins’ attorney, Doug Adams, said no because “she doesn’t have any more.”
Adams wouldn’t comment after Monday’s hearing.
At the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, Hopkins’ relatives gathered in a hallway outside of the courtroom. They shared a lengthy, tearful group embrace and prayer.
They would not speak with reporters.
Voteau, the Trinity Heights pastor, said that “all of this has taken them by surprise.”
I think they’re holding up. I think there’s a lot of questions as to how does this end? What does this look like? There’s just so many questions in this. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor, on Hopkins’ family
“I think they’re holding up. I think there’s a lot of questions as to how does this end? What does this look like?” she said. “There’s just so many questions in this.”
Hopkins is due back in federal court for a preliminary hearing in her case on March 9. But that hearing would be canceled if a grand jury decides to indict Hopkins.
Adams, the defense attorney, said during Hopkins’ hearing that the grand jury was supposed to convene Tuesday to review the case. Hopkins has not yet had an opportunity to enter a not-guilty plea in the case.

Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.
Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.
“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.
Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.
Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal
▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.
Excel Industries, 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston, touts itself on its website as a “leading manufacturer of turf care products,” including Hustler Turf Equipment and BigDog Mower Co. lines.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.

13,1,"Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court","Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court.

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting. Excel Industries is at 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston.
Ford was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed Friday in Hopkins’ case. Authorities say Hopkins was aware of his criminal history.
She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.
I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor
“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case.

A makeshift memorial to shooting victims in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 26, 2016. The Wichita Eagle
Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.
Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.
“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.
Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting. Excel Industries is at 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston.
Ford was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed Friday in Hopkins’ case. Authorities say Hopkins was aware of his criminal history.
She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.
I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor
“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case. She did ask, however, that as a condition of bond, Hopkins turn over any other guns she has in her possession to ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case. She did ask, however, that as a condition of bond, Hopkins turn over any other guns she has in her possession to ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The judge noted that the request was unusual, saying he orders defendants to surrender firearms as a matter of course.
Asked whether he objected to Furst’s request, Hopkins’ attorney, Doug Adams, said no because “she doesn’t have any more.”
Adams wouldn’t comment after Monday’s hearing.
At the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, Hopkins’ relatives gathered in a hallway outside of the courtroom. They shared a lengthy, tearful group embrace and prayer.
They would not speak with reporters.
Voteau, the Trinity Heights pastor, said that “all of this has taken them by surprise.”
I think they’re holding up. I think there’s a lot of questions as to how does this end? What does this look like? There’s just so many questions in this. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor, on Hopkins’ family
“I think they’re holding up. I think there’s a lot of questions as to how does this end? What does this look like?” she said. “There’s just so many questions in this.”
Hopkins is due back in federal court for a preliminary hearing in her case on March 9. But that hearing would be canceled if a grand jury decides to indict Hopkins.
Adams, the defense attorney, said during Hopkins’ hearing that the grand jury was supposed to convene Tuesday to review the case. Hopkins has not yet had an opportunity to enter a not-guilty plea in the case.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.
Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal
▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting. Excel Industries is at 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston.
Ford was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed Friday in Hopkins’ case. Authorities say Hopkins was aware of his criminal history.
She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.

",Q23012840,"Cedric Larry Ford Kills 3, Injures 14 in Kansas Shooting Spree","Cedric Larry Ford Kills 3, Injures 14 in Kansas Shooting Spree.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

20,1,"Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court","Sarah Jo Hopkins, accused of giving guns to Hesston shooter, appears in court.

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting. Excel Industries is at 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston.
Ford was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms because he was a convicted felon, according to a law enforcement affidavit filed Friday in Hopkins’ case. Authorities say Hopkins was aware of his criminal history.
She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.
I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor
“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case. She did ask, however, that as a condition of bond, Hopkins turn over any other guns she has in her possession to ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The judge noted that the request was unusual, saying he orders defendants to surrender firearms as a matter of course.
Asked whether he objected to Furst’s request, Hopkins’ attorney, Doug Adams, said no because “she doesn’t have any more.”
Adams wouldn’t comment after Monday’s hearing.
At the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, Hopkins’ relatives gathered in a hallway outside of the courtroom. They shared a lengthy, tearful group embrace and prayer.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.
A makeshift roadside memorial was quickly set up near Excel Industries.
Now, the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, along with city officials and employees of Excel, will walk these items to the Hesston Public Library for display and safe keeping.
Pastor John Murray of the Hesston Mennonite Church says the community is still healing.
“So many people have been affected by this; there're so many different responses,"" Murray says. ""And part of the intent of this is to honor those different responses and acknowledge that the journey continues.”
The event will be held on Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. near the intersection of Highway 81 and Ridge Road in Hesston.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

She told authorities she left the weapons with Ford after moving out of their Newton home last summer. She sought and received help from Newton police to retrieve them but returned them to Ford later because she claimed he threatened her, the affidavit says.
‘A good and loving mom’
Donna Voteau, senior pastor of Newton’s Trinity Heights United Methodist Church, in an interview after Monday’s hearing, said Hopkins and her family were shocked by the charge.
She described Hopkins as “a little reserved,” “very soft spoken” and “a good and loving mom” who attended her church sometimes with the 4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son she shares with Ford. Ford, she said, only came once to drop off the children at a summer bible school program.
“She is the kindest person you ever want to meet. … I’ve always seen that side of her,” Voteau said of Hopkins.
Hopkins, she said, had been “keeping her distance” from Ford since the couple split in July 2015. Abuse had occurred in the relationship, she said.
“Sarah was away from Cedric for quite a while. She had moved out,” Voteau said, adding that the pair’s recent struggles had been over their children, who are being cared for by relatives in the wake of their father’s death and mother’s arrest.
I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship. Donna Voteau, Sarah Hopkins’ pastor
“I don’t want to divulge her confidences, but I don’t think any of us quite comprehend what abuse does and means in a relationship,” Voteau said.
“To me, there’s a whole different take on this if people comprehend just what does abuse do.”
Court records in a paternity case filed last year in Harvey County paint an image of an on-again, off-again relationship between the couple between 2011 and 2015. The couple were not married, Voteau said.
According to the affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Hopkins bought both guns from A Pawn Shop in Newton in March 2014.
Hopkins, the affidavit says, pawned both guns sometime after buying them then retrieved the AK-47 on Feb. 5. It is unclear from the affidavit when she retrieved the .40-caliber Glock.
Voteau said Hopkins wasn’t a gun collector or enthusiast.
‘So many questions’
Ford killed three people and wounded 14 others Thursday in a shooting spree that started in Newton and ended at Excel. Harvey County authorities have said they think service of court papers filed by a woman seeking protection from abuse from Ford tipped off his rampage.
Hopkins wasn’t the woman who sought the court order.
Ford was shot and killed by law enforcement as he was heading into the plant.
Hopkins, who wore a white-and-gray striped shrug over a purple blouse and blue-jean capris in court, spoke quietly with her attorney Monday while she waited for the judge to take up her case. She smiled when several members of her family filed into the courtroom to watch the proceeding. Cuffs and shackles secured her wrists and ankles.
Hopkins said “Yes, sir” when U.S. District Court Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale asked her whether she understood the charge and posed other questions routine for initial appearances in federal court.
When he asked whether she was under the care or treatment of a doctor, Hopkins said: “Yes, sir.”
“For what?”
“Anxiety,” she said softly. She also mentioned another condition she was receiving treatment for that wasn’t clearly heard by members of the gallery.
Gale then asked Hopkins whether she was taking any medications.
“Yes, sir,” she replied but did not elaborate.
One relative of Hopkins’, a woman, cried quietly into a tissue as the hearing progressed. Another woman who sat behind her reached forward and touched her shoulder. Hopkins’ father, mother and sister were among family members in the courtroom.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Mona Furst during the hearing said the government was not asking for Hopkins to remain jailed for the duration of her case. She did ask, however, that as a condition of bond, Hopkins turn over any other guns she has in her possession to ATF, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.
The judge noted that the request was unusual, saying he orders defendants to surrender firearms as a matter of course.
Asked whether he objected to Furst’s request, Hopkins’ attorney, Doug Adams, said no because “she doesn’t have any more.”
Adams wouldn’t comment after Monday’s hearing.
At the conclusion of Monday’s hearing, Hopkins’ relatives gathered in a hallway outside of the courtroom. They shared a lengthy, tearful group embrace and prayer.
They would not speak with reporters.
Voteau, the Trinity Heights pastor, said that “all of this has taken them by surprise.”

“I think they’re holding up. I think there’s a lot of questions as to how does this end? What does this look like?” she said. “There’s just so many questions in this.”
Hopkins is due back in federal court for a preliminary hearing in her case on March 9. But that hearing would be canceled if a grand jury decides to indict Hopkins.
Adams, the defense attorney, said during Hopkins’ hearing that the grand jury was supposed to convene Tuesday to review the case. Hopkins has not yet had an opportunity to enter a not-guilty plea in the case.

The woman accused of giving guns to a man who killed three co-workers during a shooting spree in Harvey County last week won’t have to await the conclusion of her criminal case in jail.
A federal judge presiding over Sarah Jo Hopkins’ initial appearance Monday in federal court released the 28-year-old mother and child-care facility teacher on a $10,000 unsecured bond, saying she wouldn’t have to pay any money to a bondsman up front to get out of Sedgwick County Jail but could be liable for costs if she doesn’t follow the rules of her release.
Hopkins was charged Friday with transferring a firearm to a prohibited person — specifically Cedric Ford, the 38-year-old father of her children who opened fired at Hesston manufacturer Excel Industries late Thursday afternoon.
Authorities say she owns the .40-caliber semi-automatic Glock Model 22 and AK-47-style semi-automatic Zastava Serbia rifle found with Ford’s body after he was killed by law enforcement at the factory, and that she had given them to him at some point before the shooting.

A gunman opened fire in two locations in Kansas Thursday before going to his place of work and spraying bullets, leaving three people dead and 14 others in the hospital.
Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

A makeshift memorial to shooting victims in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 26, 2016. The Wichita Eagle
Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.
Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.
“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.
Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

The City of Hesston is holding a ceremony Wednesday to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and others who came to help after the shooting in February.
It has been exactly 3 months since the shooting that killed 3 people and injured 14 others before he was shot and killed by police at the Excel plant.
""We will be recognizing and thanking more than 30 federal, state, and local agencies and volunteer groups that responded to this tragedy.” He went on to say “This evening is dedicated to expressing our heart-felt thanks to those who walked into harm’s way, those who played a valuable support role, and the many volunteers who were so giving to this unthinkable tragedy,"" Hesston Mayor David Kauffman said in a release.
Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder was one of the first to arrive on scene and is credited with killing the shooter. He will received a Medal of Valor at the event. The ceremony will also feature comments by President Obama.

Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.
Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal
▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.
Excel Industries, 200 S. Ridge Road in Hesston, touts itself on its website as a “leading manufacturer of turf care products,” including Hustler Turf Equipment and BigDog Mower Co. lines.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running.

""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.
Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.
“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.
Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.
A makeshift roadside memorial was quickly set up near Excel Industries.
Now, the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, along with city officials and employees of Excel, will walk these items to the Hesston Public Library for display and safe keeping.
Pastor John Murray of the Hesston Mennonite Church says the community is still healing.
“So many people have been affected by this; there're so many different responses,"" Murray says. ""And part of the intent of this is to honor those different responses and acknowledge that the journey continues.”
The event will be held on Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. near the intersection of Highway 81 and Ridge Road in Hesston.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Before a gunman opened fire last month in Kansas, killing three people and injuring 14, he established a pattern of domestic abuse that, experts say, can frequently be a precursor to deadly violence.
U.S. Justice Department statistics show that more than 50 percent of women who are killed with guns are killed by intimate partners or family members. Kansas, like many states, relies heavily on federal funding to support services to cope with domestic violence. But advocates in the state say that despite an increase in federal grant money last year, Kansas still has unmet needs.
And while federal law prohibits the possession of guns by domestic abusers, Kansas lacks a state law that empowers local courts and law enforcement agencies to enforce it.
Women are killed with guns at higher rates by abusive partners in states with weaker gun protections in domestic violence cases, according to FBI data.

The gunman, 38-year-old Cedric Ford, shot and killed three of his co-workers in Hesston, Kansas, on Feb. 25. Ford, a convicted felon, was shot and killed by police.
He had been served earlier by Hesston police with a court-issued restraining order sought by an unidentified woman.
Another woman who had lived with Ford, now faces federal charges of transferring firearms to a convicted felon after, police say, she gave him the two guns he used in the shooting.
There is evidence in court documents, though, that the woman, Sarah Hopkins, was herself afraid of Ford. She had asked police last summer to help her retrieve the firearms when she moved out of a home she shared with Ford.
According to court documents, Sarah Hopkins then pawned the two guns but she allegedly gave them back to Ford when he threatened her.
Joyce Grover, executive director of the Kansas Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, said guns in the home of a domestic abuser can lead to deadly outcomes.
“What we know about domestic abusers is that they can be very dangerous,” she said in an interview.
Kansas allocated $4 million in state general funds in 2015 for support services to victims of domestic violence. The amount was bolstered by $19 million in federal grants from the Justice Department’s Office for Victims of Crime, and a $1-million grant from the Family Violence Prevention & Services Program of the Department of Health and Human Services.
Grover said that the additional federal funds – up from about $5.8 million in 2014 – help support legal services, child care, housing and food for domestic violence survivors.
However, Grover said, the state’s programs have always operated on a shoestring budget. “The need for services has never been fully funded,” she said.
A snapshot of Kansas taken last September by the National Network to End Domestic Violence found that many programs around the state reported a critical shortage of funds and staff to assist victims.
The shootings by Cedric Ford could spur a renewed conversation in Kansas and other states aboutgun law changes aimed at keeping the weapons out of the hands of domestic abusers. At least one state lawmaker has filed a bill to give courts and law enforcement that authority.
According to an analysis of FBI data by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety, 38 percent of mass shootings from 2009 to 2015 involved prohibited possessors – someone like Ford whose criminal record would have barred him from having guns.
Luke Entelis, counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the overwhelming caseload of federal prosecutors often places the responsibility of enforcing federal laws in the hands of local officials who may lack that authority.
“States need to put in their own prohibitions,” Entelis said. “That empowers state and local law enforcement authority to act with full authority of state law behind them.”
Ford had a tumultuous past.
In addition to convictions for burglary and theft in Florida, he also had been convicted of domestic violence and disorderly conduct in Kansas.
In a protective order filed Feb. 5 in Sedgwick County, Kansas, Ford’s unidentified former girlfriend said a verbal dispute between them became physical. “He placed me in a chokehold from behind,” she wrote, adding that she couldn’t breathe. “He then got me to the ground while choking me – finally releasing me.”
That kind of violent behavior is an indication of lethality, Grover said.
“Someone can die in a matter of seconds,” she said of the alleged choking. “To me, that is attempted murder.”
According to Everytown for Gun Safety, Kansas is not among the states that prohibit people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors or subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having guns.
Kansas also is not among a group of states that require such people to turn in their firearms, according to the group.
“More than half of states have taken concrete measures to separate firearms from domestic abusers,” Entelis said.
According to another analysis of FBI data by Everytown for Gun Safety, a woman is about eight times more likely to be shot and killed by an abusive partner in Kansas as she is in Illinois, and twice as likely as in Minnesota. Both of those states have more stringent laws restricting domestic abusers’ access to guns.
Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the National Rifle Association in Fairfax, Va., agreed that convicted domestic abusers should not have guns. She did not comment, however, on efforts by some states to require those under restraining orders to turn in their guns.
“The NRA does not want convicted domestic abusers and violent felons to have access to firearms, period,” she said in a statement. “Under federal law, these individuals are already prohibited from possessing firearms.”
The states that have enacted tougher requirements include Connecticut and New York, but also more rural and conservative Tennessee and Iowa.
“This is not a blue-state policy by any means,” Entelis said.
Legislation currently in a Kansas House of Representatives committee would empower state and local courts and law enforcement to remove guns in domestic abuse cases.
“I have no idea what will change after last weekend,” said Kansas state Rep. Barbara Bollier, a Republican and retired physician from Mission Hills who introduced the bill, in an interview. “By God, I would hope something would.”
Bollier knows the bill could be a tough sell in Kansas, which in the past year has relaxed its gun laws to allow people to carry concealed weapons without permits or training.
“At least let it be heard,” Bollier said. “Our state owes it to the people.”

The first shift returned to Excel Industries at 4:00 a.m.
Meanwhile, Sarah Jo Hopkins, 28, of Newton, Kansas pleaded not guilty in federal court to giving her former boyfriend, Cedric Ford, the guns used in the shooting.
Hopkins faces one count of transferring weapons to a prohibited person. Federal prosecutors say she gave Ford an AK-47-type semi-automatic rifle and a .40-caliber handgun that he used in the attack.
Excel says they know the healing process will take far longer than two weeks. The company told KWCH, the CBS affiliate in Wichita, that's why they've set up counseling and support systems for the long-term future.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.

▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.
Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal
▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.
A makeshift roadside memorial was quickly set up near Excel Industries.
Now, the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, along with city officials and employees of Excel, will walk these items to the Hesston Public Library for display and safe keeping.
Pastor John Murray of the Hesston Mennonite Church says the community is still healing.
“So many people have been affected by this; there're so many different responses,"" Murray says. ""And part of the intent of this is to honor those different responses and acknowledge that the journey continues.”
The event will be held on Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. near the intersection of Highway 81 and Ridge Road in Hesston.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

Three people were killed and 14 injured after a gunman drove through two Kansas towns Thursday, taking shots at people, before opening fire at a factory where he worked, NBC News reported.
The shooter was identified by family members of the shooting victims as Cedric Larry Ford. He was armed with a long gun and a pistol during the ""mass shooting"" in Newton and Hesston, towns about 30 miles north of Wichita, according to officials.
The entire incident lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead shortly after 6 p.m. ET.
The shooter was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston. Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton told a news briefing Thursday night.
The FBI and ATF were among the agencies at the scene.
Court records showed that Ford, 38, was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida including burglary.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.

▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.
Local news has never been more important Subscribe for unlimited digital access to the news that matters to your community. #readlocal
▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”
Walton said authorities have an idea of the motive, “something that triggered this particular individual.” But he did not offer any details Thursday evening.

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.

▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.
Late Thursday evening, the parking lot of the plant was encircled in crime-scene tape. Law enforcement officers had blocked off roads leading to the plant.
Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.
A makeshift roadside memorial was quickly set up near Excel Industries.
Now, the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, along with city officials and employees of Excel, will walk these items to the Hesston Public Library for display and safe keeping.
Pastor John Murray of the Hesston Mennonite Church says the community is still healing.
“So many people have been affected by this; there're so many different responses,"" Murray says. ""And part of the intent of this is to honor those different responses and acknowledge that the journey continues.”
The event will be held on Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. near the intersection of Highway 81 and Ridge Road in Hesston.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

An employee went on a shooting spree Thursday afternoon that left three people dead and injured 12 at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, about 35 miles north of Wichita.
Two other people were shot earlier, one in Newton and one on U.S. 81.
The suspected gunman – identified by two co-workers who witnessed the shootings as Cedric Ford – was shot and killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
“This is just a horrible incident here,” Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said. “It’s going to be a lot of sad people before this is all over.”

The shooting at Excel Industries, which manufactures lawn mowers and employs about 1,000 people, was reported shortly after 5 p.m. on Thursday. About 150 people were inside the plant when the shooting began.
“I heard some popping noises, but I thought it was just a drill,” said Tim Kasper, a laser operator at Excel. “Then I heard a three-round burst, and I knew it was something real.
“I got out of there quick. People were running and panicking. It was chaos.”
Law enforcement gave this account of the day’s events:
▪ The first call to 911 came at 4:57 p.m. A man was shot in the shoulder while driving near 12th and Meridian in Newton. He said he was shot by someone in another vehicle.

▪ A short time later, a report came in of a motorist shot in the leg while driving a pickup near Meridian and Hesston roads, which is between Newton and Hesston.
The vehicle driven by the shooter drove off the road, and he stole the shooting victim’s pickup and drove it to Excel.
▪ At Excel, the shooter shot one person in the parking lot before entering the building and opening fire.
“The shooter was firing on any target that came within his sights,” Walton said.
At 5:23 p.m, less than 30 minutes after the first call, the shooter was killed inside the plant by a Hesston police officer.
Walton said the officer took fire from the suspect as he entered the building. Walton said the officer “saved multiple, multiple lives.” He was not injured.
Walton said law enforcement was working to identify the victims and notify family members. Those killed, including the gunman, remained inside the plant Thursday evening.
Walton said the victims and the gunman were all killed near the front-office area of the plant. He said investigators would work through the night Thursday and Friday.
Fifteen ambulances and two helicopters were used to evacuate the wounded.
“We’re going to do what we can to take care of them and bring them through this tragedy,” Paul Mullet, president and CEO of Excel Industries, said of his employees.
The shooting comes less than a week after authorities say a man opened fire at several locations in Kalamazoo, Mich., leaving six people dead and two severely wounded.
“I ask all Kansans to offer their prayers for the victims and families of today’s shooting in Hesston,” Gov. Sam Brownback said in a statement Thursday night. “This is a tragedy that affects every member of the community and I ask that Kansans remember them in their thoughts.
“State law enforcement agencies are supporting the local authorities and I will provide any support to help them and the entire community in the days and weeks to come.”
‘Everybody was running’
Gunfire at the plant started just a few hours into the second shift, just after employees had taken their first break. It began near the paint line, employees said.
Marty Pierce said he was working in the welding shop when he heard the paint guys yelling, “Fire. Fire. Fire.”
He said he thought the building was on fire and was ready to leave when he heard a pop, pop, pop and saw people scattering and running outside. He left the building through a side door.
He said he ran into a female co-worker who said the shooter followed her outside. She hid behind a tree.
Jacob Hershberger, 20, said he was working on the mower line, about 30 yards from the paint line, when he heard three gunshots. At first he thought the guys on the paint line were building something.
Then he heard six more shots and heard someone yell, “Those are gun shots. You need to get out of here.”
He said he ran by one person who had been shot in the leg. He and other workers saw a second worker who had been shot in the back.
They loaded him onto a pallet and put him in the back of a motorized cart, and drove him out of the plant, urging him to keep his eyes open and stay awake.
A law enforcement officer directed them to hide behind a grassy hill.
An employee who said he was in the plant said he heard gunshots and people shouting to get out of the building.
“Everybody was running,” said the employee, who did not want to give his name.
He said the man, whom he recognized as a co-worker, seemed to be on a rampage.
“He was coming at everybody,” the employee said.
He said he noticed two weapons: an AK-47 and some type of handgun.
Kasper, the laser operator, said one of his co-workers, a friend, was fatally shot in the head. He said he had just talked to his friend about 10 minutes before the shooting.
“It’s pretty unnerving,” Kasper said. “Things can change fast. It was just a normal day before that.”
Suspect’s background
A preliminary check of Ford’s background Thursday evening showed he has had legal woes in Kansas and in Florida – the state he claims as home on his Facebook page.
He has had a handful of criminal cases in Harvey County, where Thursday’s shooting took place, including a misdemeanor conviction in a 2008 fighting or brawling case and various traffic violations from 2014 and 2015, district court records there show.
His Florida cases encompass crimes such as burglary, fleeing from a police officer and grand theft, according to online public records database Lexis-Nexis. The adjudication of those and other cases was immediately unclear late Thursday.
It was also unclear what sentence Ford may have received for any of his convictions.
In what may be his most recent bout of trouble prior to Thursday’s shooting, Ford was accused of assault by a woman who identified herself in Sedgwick County court records as his live-in girlfriend.
The woman, in a written petition for protection from abuse that was filed Feb. 5, says she and Ford were arguing verbally that day in the 1800 block of South Green Acres Drive when he “became physical by him pushing me then grabbing me.”
“He placed me in a choke hold from behind – I couldn’t breathe,” the woman wrote in all capital letters in her petition. “He then got me to the ground while choking me.” Eventually, she says, he let her go.
A Wichita police report dated Feb. 5 shows that an officer took the woman’s report by phone shortly after 10:30 that morning. The woman, it says, reported a person “battering her leaving visible injuries.”
Police categorized the report as a domestic violence incident with no children present. Both have children, but not together, records show.
In her petition for protection from abuse, the woman expresses concern over Ford’s demeanor and mental state.
“He is an alcoholic, violent, depressed,” she writes, again all in capital letters. “It’s my belief he is in desperate need of medical & psychological help!”
Next to a question about whether she and Ford resided together, she jotted a note: “he’s moving out.”
The wounded
Via Christi Hospital St. Francis in Wichita received six victims from the shooting, Walton said. He said that two were in critical condition and four were stable.
Wichita’s Wesley Medical Center was treating four patients Thursday evening. Walton said three were critical and one stable.
Newton Medical Center in Newton received four patients. All four were stable, and one was transferred to Wesley Medical Center because of broken bones, according to CEO Steve Kelly.
Newton Medical Center remained in lockdown Thursday evening because of a nearby situation related to the shooting at Excel.
Walton said law enforcement was trying to get into the shooter’s home, but a roommate would not allow them access. Walton said authorities were in the process of a getting a warrant to enter the house.

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Inside the parking lot, a police car had its headlights pointed at a silver pickup, which was parked near a door on the northeast side of the building, where the shooter reportedly entered. The driver’s door of the pickup stood wide open.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said. ""After he reloaded he went inside the lobby in front of the building and that is the last I seen him.""
Meanwhile, Excel's President and Chief Executive Paul Mullet said he did not know when the plant would reopen, his first priority being the victims' families.

 -- Three people were killed and 14 wounded in an horrific shooting at a Kansas workplace and two other locations Thursday evening, authorities said.
The shooter, an employee at Excel Industries -- one of the scenes -- was killed by police, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said in a press conference Thursday.
The gunman was identified as 38-year-old Newton resident Cedric Larry Ford, two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation told ABC News.
Police said the shooter fired from his car and shot people at two nearby locations before unleashing a hail of bullets in the factory, hitting 15 people, and killing three of them.
“I’m really saddened by this horrific event,"" said Excel CEO Paul Mullet. ""My heart goes out to all of the employees, all of their families.”
He was later shot to death by cops in a gun battle when a heroic officer shot him despite taking fire.
At least 14 people were hospitalized -- six at Via Christi Hospital, four at Wesley Hospital and four at Newton Medical Center, Walton said. Newton Medical Center was on lockdown due to an ongoing crime scene nearby that was related to the shooting.
Five victims are in critical condition, one person in undergoing surgery and eight are in stable condition, the sheriff said.
Walton said the carnage began about 5 p.m. when the gunman opened fire from his vehicle in a location nearby Excel.
He hit two vehicles, injuring one person.
After that, he went to another location near Highway 81, where he shot a person in the leg, police said.
After that he drove to the plant, which manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, where he opened fire before being killed by police. Police said he was using a long gun that uses .223 caliber bullets. It was not exactly clear what type.
Police said he was also believed to be carrying a pistol.
Police wanted to search the shooter's home in Newton, but a resident inside refused to leave, Walton said.
Investigators are unclear on what the shooter's motive was, but Walton said it was ""not terrorism."" But he did say there were ""some things that triggered this particular individual.""
There was only one shooter involved, Walton said.
A witness who works in the welding department said the shooter was firing off rounds as he chased Excel Industries employees who were screaming, ""Fire! Fire!""
“I thought it was a fire, explosions,” Marty Pierce told KAKE. “I didn’t know someone was shooting.”
Pierce said a coworker who looked in a hallway to investigate was shot in the leg. The 15-20 people who were in his department escaped through a side door, he said.
Nearby Hesston college was put on lockdown during the shooting, the school said on its website. There were about 375 students and faculty on campus at the time of the lockdown, KAKE reported. The lockdown was later lifted.
The Newton Police Department also said it entered Ford's Newton home after receiving conflicting reports that someone was inside.
""We had to act as if there were other victims or someone else inside who wanted to do harm,"" said Lt. Brian Hall of the Newton Police Department. ""We tried to make contact for hours and eventually had to force entry into the home. There was no one inside."" Lt. Hall did not elaborate on what was found in the home.
Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback and Wichita police offered condolences to the victims on Twitter.

Updated on 05/25/16:
A small crowd gathered around a spontaneous memorial along Highway 81 near Excel Industries in Hesston on Wednesday.
Three months ago Cedric Ford, an employee at Excel, started firing a weapon, first in nearby Newton, and soon after at his workplace. Four people, including Ford, were killed.
In the months since the shooting, four sun-bleached t-shirts have been displayed near Excel, along with a makeshift memorial with flowers, American flags, and candles.
Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.
Another event will be held at 6:30 this evening to recognize the first responders, support personnel, volunteers and the many others who assisted the day the shooting took place. The event is open to the public and will be held at the Hesston Mennonite Church, 309 S. Main. Doors open at 6 p.m.
Original Story:
Community leaders have organized a special service honoring those affected by February’s mass shooting in Newton and Excel Industries in Hesston. Four people died, including the shooter, and 14 others were injured.
A makeshift roadside memorial was quickly set up near Excel Industries.
Now, the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, along with city officials and employees of Excel, will walk these items to the Hesston Public Library for display and safe keeping.
Pastor John Murray of the Hesston Mennonite Church says the community is still healing.
“So many people have been affected by this; there're so many different responses,"" Murray says. ""And part of the intent of this is to honor those different responses and acknowledge that the journey continues.”
The event will be held on Wednesday at 2:45 p.m. near the intersection of Highway 81 and Ridge Road in Hesston.

At Least 4 Dead, Including Gunman, At Kansas Manufacturing Plant

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

A gunman who rampaged across two Kansas towns, killing three and wounding 14 others, was served with a restraining order at his workplace just 90 minutes before the attack ended in bloodshed there, officials said Friday.
The protection of abuse order, first filed by a live-in girlfriend earlier this month, may have triggered Cedric Larry Ford in the chaotic shooting spree in Newton and Hesston, about 30 miles north of Wichita, authorities said.
Ford, 38, was armed with an assault rifle and semi-automatic pistol as he began randomly shooting. His six-mile trail of violence lasted just 26 minutes — from when the gunman shot and injured a person at about 5 p.m. local time (6 p.m. ET) Thursday and stole a truck, until the first police officer on the scene shot him dead.

Ford was killed at Excel Industries, a lawn-care company in Hesston where he worked.
Fifteen of the victims were shot inside the building — including all three who died, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton first said at a news briefing Thursday night.
Walton identified the victims Friday as Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31 and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Five of the wounded remained in serious condition.
Walton told NBC News on Friday that Ford used the assault rifle during the attack, but did not appear to fire his pistol.
The sheriff, when asked about a possible motive, said a deputy had served the shooter a protection from abuse order at Excel around 3:30 p.m. It was the second such order he had received after failing to show up in court, Walton said.
""He was just shooting indiscriminately.""
Walton at a news conference Friday morning declined to detail who requested the protection order, saying the investigation was still in its early stages.
According to the paperwork, which was obtained by NBC News, a woman who filed the order Feb. 5 told the court that she was in a relationship with him and they were living together, but he was ""moving out.""
She described an incident that day that became heated after a verbal argument. She wrote that he pushed and grabbed her.
""He placed me in a choke hold from behind — I couldn’t breathe,"" the woman's statement says. ""He then got me to the ground while choking me — finally releasing me.""
The sheriff said it’s possible the court order incited the workplace carnage.
""We always say it won’t happen here. Well here it is. It happened here,"" Walton told NBC News. ""We’ll get through it. It’s a good community of good, strong people.""
Kurt Thompson, the director of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, said Friday that investigators “have a lot of work to determine what happened and why.”
“We will be here until this task is completed,” Thompson said.
The FBI and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were on the scene but the sheriff said the incident was not related to ""terrorism.""
Kansas law doesn't require a permit to buy long guns or handguns, which don't have to be registered.

An ATF official said they were investigating how Ford obtained the weapons.
Court records showed that Ford was a felon who previously lived in Miami and was on probation with a series of convictions in Florida, including burglary in 2000.
He had a criminal record stretching back to October 1996, when he was charged with carrying a concealed firearm when he was 18 years old, the records showed.
Law enforcement officials first became aware of Thursday's incident after being called to reports of two people shot and injured — one in the shoulder and one in the leg — on different streets across the two towns.
The gunman then drove north toward his workplace, where he shot another person in the parking lot, Walton said.
By the time the first police officer arrived at the scene, the gunman was ""actively shooting at any targets that came into his sights,"" Walton added.
The officer — later identified by Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback as Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder — went in alone, killed the gunman and ""saved a lot of lives,"" the sheriff said.
Walton said the shooter would have fired ""until he was out of ammo. I don't know how much he had. … He was just shooting indiscriminately.""

Another officer who arrived, Hesston police Sgt. Chris Carter, told reporters Friday morning that his adrenaline kicked in as he entered the building, where about 200 to 300 people were inside. Some of his relatives work at Excel, he said.
""What crossed my mind was finding the bad guy, protecting everyone else who was there,"" Carter said. “Overwhelming. But we’re on auto-pilot. We’re trained for these. We just do what we’re trained to do.""
Carter, who was driving a pickup truck, managed to help one of the victims. Walton hailed Carter as ""another hero.""
A couple of hours later, Newton police and a SWAT team converged on a home in a Newton trailer park where the gunman was believed to have lived.
Walton told reporters that the shooter's roommate was inside and refusing to engage with officers — but when officials obtained a warrant and returned at 10 p.m., they found the property empty, NBC station KSN reported.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences for the victims Friday, but said the country cannot become numb to gun violence.
The ""real tragedy is the degree to which this has become routine,"" he told reporters. ""Once a week we have these shootings and it doesn’t dominate the news, and that’s got to change.""
Gary Emry, the city administrator of Hesston, said Obama had called him and Hesston Mayor David Kauffman on Friday.
One of the injured at Excel Industries was Dennis Britton, who was shot in the right buttock and suffered a fractured right femur, according to his father.
Dennis Britton Sr., also an Excel employee, told NBC News his son ""made eye contact with [the shooter] when he walked away,"" and that he ""heard a clap and hit the floor"" after being shot.
""It's rough, I'm not going to lie to you,"" Britton said. ""He was like all the rest of them there. He's a family man. He's got three kids and one on the way.""
Martin Espinoza, who works at Excel, was in the plant during the shooting, he told the AP. He heard people yelling to others to get out of the building, then heard popping, then saw the shooter, a co-worker he described as typically pretty calm.
Espinoza said the shooter pointed a gun at him and pulled the trigger, but the gun was empty. At that point, the gunman got a different gun and Espinoza ran.
""I took off running. He came outside after a few people, shot outside a few times, shot at the officers coming onto the scene at the moment and then reloaded in front of the company,"" Espinoza said.

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""

Gary Blaine, a Pastor at Highland Trinity United Church of Christ and a member of the Hesston Ministerial Alliance, was among the speakers at the event.
""Some people may think that we are gathered in front of things that are now faded and tired,"" Blaine says. ""But I'd like for you to consider the possibility that these are sacred objects. And they're sacred objects because they come out of suffering.""
Following the service, the items from the memorial were gathered and taken, by way of a procession, to the Hesston library where they will be permanently held.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

Four people are dead, including the shooter, and at least 14 are injured after an employee opened fire at a manufacturing plant in Hesston, Kan., according to Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton.
The suspected shooter was killed inside the plant by the first officer at the scene, Walton said at a press conference late Thursday.
""Even though he took fire, he went inside of this place, and saved multiple, multiple lives,"" he said.
Officers responded to the first calls around 5 p.m. CT after shootings in nearby Newton, Kan. Walton said the gunman then ran his car off the road, shot another person and stole their car.
He then drove to Excel Industries, the turf care products manufacturer where he worked, Walton said, and entered the building with an assault-style rifle and a handgun. At least 150 people were in the plant at the time for the second shift of the day.
The sheriff said the shootings appeared to be random, and that authorities believed they had a lead on the gunman's motive.
""Not terrorism,"" he said. ""There were some things that triggered this particular individual.""
A half-dozen city, county, state and national agencies responded to the shootings, Walton said, and two helicopters and 15 ambulances were used to evacuate victims, several of whom remain in critical condition.
Others in the plant at the time were reunited with their loved ones at a nearby high school, where authorities also planned to conduct about 200 interviews, and where counseling was also being provided.
""Everybody says it can't happen here, but it's all those places that it happens at,"" Walton said. ""This is a fairly peaceful community, and to have something like this is tragic.""

",Q23012840,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

A gunman opened fire in two locations in Kansas Thursday before going to his place of work and spraying bullets, leaving three people dead and 14 others in the hospital.
Interested in ? Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest
Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.

88,1,Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter,"Toxicology report reveals high doses of meth in the system of the Hesston shooter.

The Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center has released the autopsy results for the man who shot and killed three people and injured 14 others at Excel Industries in Hesston on Feb. 25.
According to the report, Cedric Ford died from multiple gunshot wounds including ones to his left arm, left back, right lower chest and right abdomen.
Toxicology results reveal Ford had methamphetamine and alcohol in his system when he died. Experts said the levels were high, especially the methamphetamine.
Wayne Simpson is the Facility Director at Recovery Unlimited and said methamphetamine causes people to experience insomnia.
""The longer we stay awake, it creates a psychosis state of mind,"" he said.
Alcohol affects the amygdala in the brain and the combination of the two, Simpson said, can cause serious and concerning effects.
""When we take alcohol and we become angry, the reasoning part of the brain does not react to that and it's going to continue to go into more anger because we have nothing to stop that,"" he said. ""So when we start to mix alcohol and methamphetamine together in a psychosis state of mind and an agitated state of mind, it continues to get more erratic.""
Simpson said while drugs don't necessarily make someone do something, they affect how a person acts and what they are willing to do.
""This had probably a big impact on his courage and his state of mind in order to fulfill this,"" Simpson said. ""I think he has some other problems.""
Simpson said it's hard to know how long Ford took meth. He said he may have built a tolerance to it but there's no way of knowing. While looking at the toxicology, he said the numbers would look the same regardless of how easily Ford could handle the drug.
But Simpson said the high level shows Ford took a lot of meth quickly.
""Methamphetamine has approximately a 12 hour half-life so he had to continue to use this meth, high doses in 12 hours in order to bring his meth level up that high,"" he said.
Eyewitness News asked Attorney Charley O'Hara if the drugs would change any part of the investigation or tie anyone else to the crime. He said in this case, no.
""If someone sold him the illegal drugs, number one, you'd have to prove who did that but I don't know if it's even foreseeable then if someone sells you illegal drugs that someone's going to go to a business and shoot people and try to kill them,"" he said.
O'Hara said the key words are 'reasonably foreseeable' and in this case, there isn't anyone who could have reasonably predicting what Ford would do.
It's unclear if Excel Industries does random drug tests but O'Hara said that wouldn't matter because again, there's no way the company could have known what Ford was going to do.
""If somebody just works for you and they're off work and they come in suddenly one day and they do something that they've never done before, no one's really probably liable,"" he said.
If there had been warning of the violence or if there was any security measures that should have been taken, O'Hara said things may be different.
""We're just speaking about somebody just doing something that makes no sense to the rest of us at all,"" O'Hara said.
Ford had been served a protection order at work at Excel Industries hours before the shooting.
He was shot and killed by Hesston Police Chief Doug Schroeder, who is credited with saving numerous lives by ending the threat.

Hopkins faces one count of transferring weapons to a prohibited person. Federal prosecutors say she gave Ford an AK-47-type semi-automatic rifle and a .40-caliber handgun that he used in the attack.
Excel says they know the healing process will take far longer than two weeks. The company told KWCH, the CBS affiliate in Wichita, that's why they've set up counseling and support systems for the long-term future.

Here's a step-by-step look at what happened, according to authorities.
The Restraining Order
The suspect, identified by police as Cedric Larry Ford, 38, of Newton, Kansas, was at his place of work, Excel Industries, a plant that manufactures heavy-duty lawn care equipment, when he was served around 3:30 p.m. with a restraining order meant to keep him away from a former girlfriend, Harvey County Sheriff T. Walton said.
""It's normal when someone gets served a protection of abuse order"" to be upset, Walton said this morning, explaining that Ford's behavior wasn't abnormal when he was served.
In the temporary order of protection from abuse, the woman, whose name is not being published by ABC News, wrote that she and Ford were living together but broke up. He was moving out.
She wrote that on Feb. 5, she and Ford ""were verbally fighting"" when ""it became physical by him pushing me and then grabbing me.""
""He placed me in a chokehold from behind,"" she wrote, saying that she couldn't breathe. ""He then got me to ground while choking me—finally releasing me.""
The woman describes Ford as an “alcoholic,” “violent” and “depressed,"" according to the order of protection from abuse.
Walton told ABC News that investigators still have many interviews to conduct but, at this point, his apparent domestic troubles appear to have possibly been a trigger.
First Shooting
The first shooting was about 5 p.m. at an intersection in Newton, Kansas. A man said he was driving with his two children when he was shot in the shoulder, authorities said.
A second car was also targeted, with the bullet going through the windshield. But that driver wasn't hit, authorities said.
Second Shooting
Then a gunman started shooting head-on into oncoming traffic, authorities said. The shooter's car and another car went into a ditch, and the shooter shot a victim in the leg, authorities said. The gunman then took the victim's car, authorities said.
Third Shooting: Excel Industries
The shooter then drove to Excel Industries in Hesston, about 6 miles north of the first shooting, where he shot someone in the parking lot, authorities said.
He then entered the building and unleashed bullets. The shooter didn't target specific people at the plant and instead fired randomly, according to authorities.
Three people were killed at Excel. They were identified today as: Renee Benjamin, 30; Joshua Higbee, 31; and Brian Sadowsky, 44.
Overall, the three shootings covered a range of about 6 miles and lasted a span of about 24 minutes, Walton said today.
At least 14 people were hospitalized, including some victims in critical condition.
Police Shootout
A responding officer at Excel exchanged gunfire with Ford, killing him at 5:24 p.m., authorities said.
Walton said today that Ford, who authorities said had an assault rifle and a pistol, would have kept shooting if a police officer had not stopped him.
The Investigation

Ford was known to police and been in the local jail a few times, authorities said.
Authorities do not know how he obtained the weapons.
Investigators are also unclear on the motive, but Walton told ABC News that it is ""most likely domestic violence.""
Excel CEO Paul Mullet said today the company is fully cooperating with the investigation.
